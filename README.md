# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the analysis of customer data aimed at segmenting customers into homogeneous groups based on their characteristics. The analysis was conducted as part of a project to understand customer behavior and improve personalized services.

## Analysis Steps

### Data Collection

The customer data used in this analysis was collected from donnes_client.csv . It includes information such as age, annual income, and spending score.

### Data Cleaning

The data cleansing process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers to ensure data quality and reliability.

### Data Normalization

Normalization was performed to bring all features to the same scale, facilitating comparison and analysis.

### Implementation of K-Means Algorithm

The K-Means algorithm, a popular clustering technique, was applied to partition customers into distinct clusters based on their similarities.

### Interpretation of Clusters

Clusters were thoroughly analyzed to discern the characteristics and profiles of different customer groups, providing valuable insights for decision-making and strategy development.

### Visualization of Results

The analysis results were visualized using appropriate graphs and charts to facilitate understanding and interpretation.

## Conclusion

The segmentation analysis successfully grouped customers into homogeneous clusters, offering valuable insights for decision-making, targeted marketing, and service personalization.

## Future Directions

Further analysis could include exploring additional clustering algorithms, incorporating more features for segmentation, and conducting predictive modeling to anticipate future customer behavior.
